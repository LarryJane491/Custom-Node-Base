# Custom-Node-Base
This is a custom node for ComfyUI... but it does nothing ^^. The official example for custom nodes isn't in its own folder and doesn't explain much, so I decided to make my own.
This project is an "empty" custom node that is already in its own folder. It serves as a base to build any custom node. Whenever you want to create a custom node, you can download that, put it in custom_nodes, then you just have to change the names and fill it with code!

If you want to learn how to make your own custom nodes, here is my tutorial that gets you started in 5 minutes:
